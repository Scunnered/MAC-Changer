# Ethical Hacking with Python
In this repository I will be creating handy to have scripts for aspiring ethical hackers like myself.
You will find below a list of script names, descriptors and why they are needed.

These scripts have been created in PyCharm on Kali Linux on VirtualBox:

As stated in the description... each script is for educational use only!
